"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy with chronic recurrent pharyngitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy with chronic recurrent pharyngitis.,SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal technique.,SURGICAL FINDINGS: ,A 4+/4+ cryptic and hypertrophic tonsils with 2+/3+ hypertrophic adenoid pads.,INDICATIONS: , We were requested to evaluate the patient for complaints of enlarged tonsils, which cause difficulty swallowing, recurrent pharyngitis, and sleep-induced respiratory disturbance. She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY: ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthetic was administered. Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy. He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx. Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized. The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa. This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris. Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts. With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads. The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique. The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic. It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction. The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle. The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period. The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic. She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal. There were no complications. Specimens produced were right and left tonsils. The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery.","The patient underwent a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedure to treat obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy with chronic recurrent pharyngitis. The surgical findings included 4+/4+ cryptic and hypertrophic tonsils with 2+/3+ hypertrophic adenoid pads. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The patient was placed in a semi-Rose position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx. The right and left tonsils were removed using electrocautery enucleation technique, and the adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery. The estimated blood loss was minimal, and there were no complications. The specimens produced were the right and left tonsils."
"DIAGNOSIS:, Desires vasectomy.,NAME OF OPERATION: , Vasectomy.,ANESTHESIA:, General.,HISTORY: , Patient, 37, desires a vasectomy.,PROCEDURE: , Through a midline scrotal incision, the right vas was identified and separated from the surrounding tissues, clamped, transected, and tied off with a 4-0 chromic. No bleeding was identified.,Through the same incision the left side was identified, transected, tied off, and dropped back into the wound. Again no bleeding was noted.,The wound was closed with 4-0 Vicryl times two. He tolerated the procedure well. A sterile dressing was applied. He was awakened and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","The patient, a 37-year-old man, underwent a vasectomy procedure. The procedure was performed through a midline scrotal incision, and the right and left vas deferens were identified, transected, and tied off with a 4-0 chromic. The wound was closed with 4-0 Vicryl, and the patient tolerated the procedure well."
"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

Passive hip motion also elicits bilateral hip pain referred to the ipsilateral side.  Toe-heel walking is performed without difficulty.  Straight leg raises are negative.  Romberg's are negative.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.  Intact reflexes in all extremities tested.  Romberg is negative and downgoing.,ASSESSMENT:,1. Osteoarthritis.,2. Chronic sacroiliitis.,3. Lumbar spondylosis.,4. Migraine.,5. TMJ arthropathy secondary to bruxism.,6. Mood disorder secondary to chronic pain.,7. Attention deficit disorder, currently untreated and self diagnosed.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. Agree with Rheumatology referral and review.  I would particularly be interested in the patient pursuing a bone density scan as well as thyroid and parathyroid studies.,2. Given the patient's previous sulfa allergies, we would recommend decreasing her Naprosyn usage."," The patient is a 41-year-old white woman with a history of osteoarthritis, chronic sacroiliitis, lumbar spondylosis, migraine, TMJ arthropathy, mood disorder, and attention deficit disorder.
